#  What are z in blackouts and why are they stopping poker tournaments near me?
On July 12th, 2018, a power outage hit the Bellagio Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. The outage caused a massive blackout that left the casino in complete darkness. This isn't the first time that a casino in Las Vegas has had a blackout. Earlier this year, another power outage shut down parts of the MGM Grand Resort and Casino. In both cases, the casinos were forced to stop their poker tournaments due to the lack of power.

While blackouts can be disruptive for any business, they can be particularly damaging for casinos. Casinos rely on power to run their slot machines, gaming tables, and other gambling devices. When there is a power outage, these devices are not able to function, which can lead to losses for the casino.

There are a number of reasons why blackouts can occur in casinos. One common reason is due to storm damage. High winds and rain can cause power lines to come down, which can lead to a blackout. Another common reason for blackouts is generator failure. If the generators at a casino are not working properly, it can lead to a loss of power.

Blackouts can also be caused by human error. In some cases, employees may mistakenly turn off the power when they are cleaning or doing maintenance work in the casino. This mistake can lead to a loss of power that lasts for hours or even days.

In addition to causing financial losses for casinos, blackouts can also create safety risks for customers and employees. When there is no light, it can be difficult to see what is going on around you, which can lead to accidents or injuries. In some cases, blackouts have also been linked to crime sprees by thieves who take advantage of the darkness to commit crimes undisturbed.

Casinos are not the only businesses that have been affected by blackouts in recent years. Hospitals, schools, and office buildings have all been impacted by widespread outages in recent years. These outages often occur during times of extreme weather such as tornadoes or hurricanes.

While outages are an inconvenience for any business, they can be particularly damaging for casinos which rely on power for their operations
