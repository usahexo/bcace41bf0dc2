#  Mariners on a roll, odds to pay out in full!

The Seattle Mariners have been on a roll lately, and the odds makers are finally starting to pay out on bets placed on them. After a dismal start to the season, the Mariners have turned things around and currently sit just two games out of first place in the AL West.

This turnaround is thanks in part to some hot hitting from their stars, such as Robinson Cano, Nelson Cruz, and Kyle Seager. But it's also been fueled by some impressive pitching from their starters and bullpen. Felix Hernandez has been his usual dominant self, while newcomers Hisashi Iwakuma and Chris Young have also pitched well.

All of this has led to increased confidence among the players and fans alike that the Mariners can win the division this year. And if they do, those who have placed bets on them will be handsomely rewarded.

The current odds for the Mariners to win the AL West are 3-1, which means a $100 bet would payout $300. So if you're feeling confident about Seattle's chances, now is definitely the time to place a bet!

#  Mariners looking for sweep, payout possible!

The Seattle Mariners look to complete their sweep of the Texas Rangers on Sunday. A sweep would be a great way to finish off the homestand for the Mariners and could result in a nice payout for bettors.

The Mariners have been playing great baseball as of late, winning seven of their last ten games. They are coming off a series win over the Rangers and will look to keep the momentum going on Sunday. The Rangers have not been playing very well lately, losing six of their last nine games.

In the first game of the series, the Mariners won 7-6 in 11 innings. Robinson Cano hit a walk-off home run in the eleventh inning to give the Mariners the win. In game two, the Rangers won 10-7. In game three, the Mariners won 5-2 behind a solid outing by starter Wade LeBlanc.

The Mariners will send left-hander Marco Gonzales to the mound on Sunday. Gonzales has been good this season, posting a 3-3 record with a 3.38 ERA in eight starts. The Rangers will counter with right-hander Bartolo Colon. Colon has not had much success this season, posting a 2-4 record with a 8.14 ERA in eight starts.

The Mariners are favored to win this game and should be able to complete their sweep of the Rangers on Sunday.

#  Odds in Mariners favor as they head into the final games of the series!

Heading into the final games of the series, the Mariners have a good chance of winning. The odds are in their favor, as they have proved throughout the season.

Since the beginning of the year, the Mariners have been a top team. They have had some rough patches throughout the season, but they always seem to come out on top in the end. One big reason for their success is their strong bullpen.

The Mariners’ bullpen has been one of the best in baseball this year. They have done an excellent job of shutting down opposing teams late in games. This has allowed the Mariners to come back and win many close games.

Another reason for the Mariners’ success is their offense. They have been able to score runs when they need to and get key hits when they need them most. This has helped them win a lot of tight games this year.

If the Mariners can continue to play well and take advantage of their opportunities, they should be able to win the division and make it to the playoffs. The odds are definitely in their favor as they head into these final games!

#  Sweep would mean big payout for Mariners fans!

[Seattle Mariners](https://www.mlb.com/mariners/) look to make a big splash in the free agent market by signing prized slugger Edwin Encarnacion.

The addition of Encarnacion would solidify the Mariners lineup and likely result in a postseason berth for the first time since 2001.

The contract negotiations are still in their early stages, but it is clear that Seattle is serious about landing the top free agent on the market.

Adding Encarnacion would give the Mariners a middle of the order consisting of Robinson Cano, Nelson Cruz and Edwin Encarnacion. That type of power would be too much for any pitching staff to handle.

If Seattle can pull off this signing, it would be a monumental event for Mariners fans. This could be the most significant offseason move in franchise history and would result in a lot of happy fans at Safeco Field.
