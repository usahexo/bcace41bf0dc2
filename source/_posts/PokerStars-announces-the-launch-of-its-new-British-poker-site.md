#  PokerStars announces the launch of its new British poker site

On Tuesday, PokerStars announced the launch of its new British poker site, which will allow players in the UK to play poker online. The site will be available in both English and Welsh, and will offer a wide range of games, including cash games, Sit & Gos, and tournaments.

In addition to the launch of the new site, PokerStars also announced that it has reached an agreement with the Gambling Commission to become a licensed operator in the UK. As part of the agreement, PokerStars will pay £7 million (approximately $10 million) in licensing fees, and will be subject to strict regulations governing the operation of its site.

"We are excited to be launching our new British poker site," said Eric Hollreiser, Vice President of Corporate Communications for PokerStars. "This is a key market for us and we are committed to providing our players with the best possible experience."

The launch of the new British poker site comes at a time when online gaming is becoming increasingly popular in the UK. A recent study by Ipsos Mori found that one-third of adults in the UK have gambled online in the past year, and that 17% have played poker online.

"The growth of online gambling in the UK is testimony to its popularity," said Hollreiser. "PokerStars is committed to being at the forefront of this growth, and our new British poker site will provide players with a world-class experience."

#  PokerStars set to become the biggest online casino in Britain

PokerStars, the world’s biggest online poker room, is on the verge of completing a takeover of British casino giant GVC Holdings, in a deal that will make it the biggest online casino operator in Britain.

The offer from Stars, which is owned by Canada’s Amaya Inc., values GVC at £4.7bn ($6.2bn) and is expected to be approved by shareholders next week.

The takeover would give PokerStars a dominant market position in Britain, where online casinos are growing rapidly in popularity. GVC operates several brands including Bwin, PartyCasino and Sportingbet.

PokerStars has been seeking to enter the live casino market for some time, and the acquisition of GVC would give it a strong presence in Europe’s largest gambling market. The two companies already have a close relationship, with GVC providing technology and platform services to PokerStars.

The move comes as the global gambling industry undergoes rapid consolidation, with major players looking to expand their operations into new markets. In June last year, Amaya itself was acquired by Montreal-based gaming company The Stars Group in a $4.9bn deal.

The Stars Group is expected to retain PokerStars’ brand following the takeover of GVC.

#  PokerStars launching new website specifically for British players

PokerStars is rolling out a new website designed specifically for British players. The website will offer a range of games and tournaments tailored to British players, as well as a range of promotions and bonuses.

The new website is part of PokerStars' commitment to the UK market, following the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) decision in April to license online poker and betting operators.

PokerStars UK Country Manager Eoin Parker said: "We are excited to be launching our new website, which will offer a tailored experience for British players. We are committed to the UK market and we believe this new site will be popular with our players."

The new website offers a range of featuresincluding a 'player leaderboard' that allows players to compete against each other for the highest rankings, as well as daily and weekly tournaments with prize pools of up to £100,000. There is also a comprehensive loyalty scheme that rewards players with points for every pound they spend on tournaments and cash games. These points can then be redeemed for bonuses and merchandise.

The launch of the PokerStars UK website follows the successful launch of PokerStars Spain earlier this year.
