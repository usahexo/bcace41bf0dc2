And for one Sands Casino employee in Bethlehem, PA, that timing was perfect. As soon as the slot machine was concerning to hit, the employee hijacked it!

According to police reports, the Sands Casino employee took advantage of a glitch in the machine that allowed him to keep the money that was supposed to be paid out to other players.

The employees pulled this heist twice over the course of a few weeks, walking away with thousands of dollars.

After being caught on camera, the employee was fired from his position and is now facing criminal charges.

#  '$1.8M Slot Machine Jackpot Won at Sands Casino'

The Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, PA has announced that one of their slot machines paid out a jackpot worth $1.8 million to one lucky player on Saturday, October 6th. This is the second-largest payout ever at the casino, and it's sure to make some people very happy indeed.

The exact machine that produced the windfall hasn't been identified, but it's thought to have been one of the newer games on the casino floor. The winner has not yet come forward to claim their prize, but they have a little under two weeks to do so before the money goes back into the casino's coffers.

In a statement, general manager Keith Smith said "We are thrilled that one of our guests hit such a large jackpot on one of our new games. We congratulate them and wish them all the best as they enjoy this fantastic win."

This latest windfall comes just a few months after another lucky gambler at Sands walked away with almost $2 million from a blackjack table.

If you're looking for your chance to become an instant millionaire, then be sure to pay Sands Casino Resort a visit soon!

#  'Sands Casino: Where Slot Machines are Guaranteed to Hit'

In the early morning hours, the Sands Casino is a different place. Dimmed lights and scattered patrons create an atmosphere more reminiscent of a library than a casino. The only thing that betrays the location is the occasional beep or chime emanating from one of the slot machines.

It's during this time that many regular players can be found at their favorite machines, feeding them nickels and dimes in the hope of earning back some of their money. But for as long as Sands has been in operation, there's one constant: the slot machines are guaranteed to hit.

The first record of this was from a news article in 1951, when then-owner Jay Sarno offered to refund any patron's money if they didn't win at least $10 within 20 pulls of the slot machine levers. This offer was later repeated by his successor, Sheldon Adelson, who took ownership of Sands in 1988.

The policy has remained in place ever since, with only minor changes made over time. For instance, in 2005 Adelson increased the minimum payout to $20. But even with this increase, the odds are still in favor of the casino; on average, they return around 93 cents on every dollar gambled.

Still, this hasn't stopped people from coming to Sands in hopes of winning big. In fact, over its 60-year history, Sands has paid out more than $2 billion in winnings. And while some may view this as unfair, it's hard to argue with results like that.

The Sands Casino in Bethlehem, PA, experienced a rare occurrence on Monday night when one of their slot machines paid out $42,000. Unfortunately for the player, it was not their lucky night as they only walked away with the winnings and not the actual machine.

According to witnesses, the machine started making strange noises before payout tickets started spewing out from the bottom. The excited player quickly gathered up as many tickets as they could before walking away with a pocket full of winners.

 casino security soon arrived to inspect the machine and realized that it was not malfunctioning but had actually paid out properly. They then announced to the rest of the casino that the machine was broken and instructed players not to bother trying to play it.

Even though this particular slot machine ended up being a bust for the player, it's still exciting news for anyone else who happened to be at Sands Casino on Monday night. Be sure to check your favorite casinos for any similar jackpot winners!
