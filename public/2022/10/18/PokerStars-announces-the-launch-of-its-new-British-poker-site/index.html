        <h1 id="PokerStars-announces-the-launch-of-its-new-British-poker-site"><a href="#PokerStars-announces-the-launch-of-its-new-British-poker-site" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars announces the launch of its new British poker site"></a>PokerStars announces the launch of its new British poker site</h1><p>On Tuesday, PokerStars announced the launch of its new British poker site, which will allow players in the UK to play poker online. The site will be available in both English and Welsh, and will offer a wide range of games, including cash games, Sit &amp; Gos, and tournaments.</p>
<p>In addition to the launch of the new site, PokerStars also announced that it has reached an agreement with the Gambling Commission to become a licensed operator in the UK. As part of the agreement, PokerStars will pay £7 million (approximately $10 million) in licensing fees, and will be subject to strict regulations governing the operation of its site.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be launching our new British poker site,” said Eric Hollreiser, Vice President of Corporate Communications for PokerStars. “This is a key market for us and we are committed to providing our players with the best possible experience.”</p>
<p>The launch of the new British poker site comes at a time when online gaming is becoming increasingly popular in the UK. A recent study by Ipsos Mori found that one-third of adults in the UK have gambled online in the past year, and that 17% have played poker online.</p>
<p>“The growth of online gambling in the UK is testimony to its popularity,” said Hollreiser. “PokerStars is committed to being at the forefront of this growth, and our new British poker site will provide players with a world-class experience.”</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-to-sponsor-UK-Poker-Championship"><a href="#PokerStars-to-sponsor-UK-Poker-Championship" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars to sponsor UK Poker Championship"></a>PokerStars to sponsor UK Poker Championship</h1><p>The <a href="https://www.pokerstars.com/" target="_blank">PokerStars</a> brand will be the headline sponsor of the hugely popular <a href="https://www.ukpokercampionship.com/" target="_blank">UK Poker Championship</a> for the next three years, starting in 2019.<br /><br />The UK Poker Championship is one of the most well-known and respected tournaments on the UK poker calendar, and has been running since 2007. It’s a major stop on both the live and online poker circuits, with a huge prize pool and a star-studded player field. The event is open to players of all levels, from amateurs to pros, with buy-ins ranging from £220 to £2,200. <br /><br />Commenting on the sponsorship, John Duthie, founder of the UK Poker Championship, said: “We are absolutely delighted to have PokerStars as our headline sponsor for the next three years. We have worked closely with them for many years and they are without doubt the biggest and best online poker company in the world. This partnership is testimony to both our brands’ commitment to providing top-class experiences for players of all levels.”<br /><br />Raymond Calvaruso, Director of Live Operations at PokerStars added: “The UK Poker Championship is one of Europe’s most prestigious tournaments and we’re proud to be its title sponsor. The event attracts some of the best players in the world, so it’s going to be very exciting to see how they compete against each other over the next three years. We can’t wait to get started!”<br /><br />For more information on the upcoming UK Poker Championship visit <a href="https://www.ukpokercampionship.com/" target="_blank">ukpokercampionship.com</a>.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-set-to-become-the-biggest-online-casino-in-Britain"><a href="#PokerStars-set-to-become-the-biggest-online-casino-in-Britain" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars set to become the biggest online casino in Britain"></a>PokerStars set to become the biggest online casino in Britain</h1><p>PokerStars, the world’s biggest online poker room, is on the verge of completing a takeover of British casino giant GVC Holdings, in a deal that will make it the biggest online casino operator in Britain.</p>
<p>The offer from Stars, which is owned by Canada’s Amaya Inc., values GVC at £4.7bn ($6.2bn) and is expected to be approved by shareholders next week.</p>
<p>The takeover would give PokerStars a dominant market position in Britain, where online casinos are growing rapidly in popularity. GVC operates several brands including Bwin, PartyCasino and Sportingbet.</p>
<p>PokerStars has been seeking to enter the live casino market for some time, and the acquisition of GVC would give it a strong presence in Europe’s largest gambling market. The two companies already have a close relationship, with GVC providing technology and platform services to PokerStars.</p>
<p>The move comes as the global gambling industry undergoes rapid consolidation, with major players looking to expand their operations into new markets. In June last year, Amaya itself was acquired by Montreal-based gaming company The Stars Group in a $4.9bn deal.</p>
<p>The Stars Group is expected to retain PokerStars’ brand following the takeover of GVC.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-launching-new-website-specifically-for-British-players"><a href="#PokerStars-launching-new-website-specifically-for-British-players" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars launching new website specifically for British players"></a>PokerStars launching new website specifically for British players</h1><p>PokerStars is rolling out a new website designed specifically for British players. The website will offer a range of games and tournaments tailored to British players, as well as a range of promotions and bonuses.</p>
<p>The new website is part of PokerStars’ commitment to the UK market, following the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s (DCMS) decision in April to license online poker and betting operators.</p>
<p>PokerStars UK Country Manager Eoin Parker said: “We are excited to be launching our new website, which will offer a tailored experience for British players. We are committed to the UK market and we believe this new site will be popular with our players.”</p>
<p>The new website offers a range of featuresincluding a ‘player leaderboard’ that allows players to compete against each other for the highest rankings, as well as daily and weekly tournaments with prize pools of up to £100,000. There is also a comprehensive loyalty scheme that rewards players with points for every pound they spend on tournaments and cash games. These points can then be redeemed for bonuses and merchandise.</p>
<p>The launch of the PokerStars UK website follows the successful launch of PokerStars Spain earlier this year.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-announce-partnership-with-the-UK-Poker-Championships"><a href="#PokerStars-announce-partnership-with-the-UK-Poker-Championships" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars announce partnership with the UK Poker Championships"></a>PokerStars announce partnership with the UK Poker Championships</h1><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pokerstars.com/"></a> PokerStars have announced a new three-year partnership with the UK Poker Championships (UKPC). The deal will see PokerStars as the title sponsor of the event, which is currently in its eleventh year.</p>
<p>The UKPC is one of the most prestigious tournaments on the UK poker calendar, and attracts some of the world’s best players. This year’s event is scheduled to take place at Aspers Casino in London from October 5-15, and will feature a £1 million guarantee.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Team PokerStars Pro Chris Moorman said: “I’m really excited about this sponsorship. The UKPC is one of my favourite tournaments of the year and I’m looking forward to trying to add my name to the trophy.”</p>
<p>The UKPC will be the latest high-profile live event to be added to PokerStars’ ever-growing sponsorship portfolio. The company has previously sponsored major tournaments such as the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure, European Poker Tour, and PokerStars Championship events.</p>
