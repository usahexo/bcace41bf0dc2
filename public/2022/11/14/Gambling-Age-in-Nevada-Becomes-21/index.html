The new law takes effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>The legislation was introduced by state Senator Becky Harris and Assemblyman James Ohrenschall. It was passed by the Nevada State Legislature last month.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval said in a statement: “I am proud to sign this legislation that will help keep our communities safe. Making gambling age 21 is a common sense reform that will protect families and young people.”</p>
<p>Senator Harris said: “This legislation will help to keep our communities safe by making it more difficult for young people to gamble. I am grateful to Governor Sandoval for his support of this important issue.”</p>
<p>Assemblyman Ohrenschall said: “I’m glad to see this common-sense measure become law. It will help to protect our young people from the dangers of gambling.”</p>
<p>Under the new law, casino employees who knowingly allow people under 21 to gamble could face criminal charges.</p>
<h1 id="All-Gambling-Ages-Across-the-Country-to-be-21"><a href="#All-Gambling-Ages-Across-the-Country-to-be-21" class="headerlink" title="All Gambling Ages Across the Country to be 21"></a>All Gambling Ages Across the Country to be 21</h1><p>Gambling is a popular pastime here in the United States. From lotteries to casinos, people of all ages enjoy trying their luck. But did you know that the legal gambling age varies from state to state?</p>
<p>In some states, the minimum gambling age is just 18. In others, it’s 21. The inconsistency can be confusing for both tourists and residents alike. So, what’s the deal? Why are there different gambling ages across the country?</p>
<p>The answer has to do with history. Way back when, different states had different gambling ages because the laws governing them were enacted at different times. Some states set the minimum gambling age at 18 because that was the age of majority at the time. Other states, including California and Idaho, set the age at 21 because that’s when you could legally drink alcohol.</p>
<p>But times have changed. In fact, Delaware was the first state to raise its minimum gambling age to 21 in 1976. Since then, many other states have followed suit. Today, only a handful of states still allow minors to gamble legally.</p>
<p>So why is the legal gambling age going up? Well, there are a few reasons. For one thing, research shows that minors are more susceptible to problem gambling than adults are. Secondly, many experts believe that raising the gambling age will help reduce underage drinking and drug use. And finally, it’s simply becoming harder and harder for minors to get their hands on casino or lottery tickets – especially given all of the security measures that are now in place.</p>
<p>Bottom line: if you want to gamble in America, you have to be 21 years old or older. If you’re visiting a state where the minimum age is lower than 21, be sure to check out its gambling laws before putting any money down!</p>

This age increase has been put into place over time, as different states have voted to change it.</p>
<p>The change in the law has been praised by some as a way to help people stay out of financial trouble, while others criticize it as an infringement on people’s rights.</p>
<p>Most recently, New Hampshire became the latest state to make the change, with Illinois following suit shortly thereafter. In Illinois, the change in the law went into effect on July 1st of this year.</p>
<p>Many other states have made the change in recent years, including Mississippi, Indiana, and Louisiana. The trend is likely to continue, as more and more states seek to protect their citizens from gambling addiction and other risks associated with casino gaming.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Age-Increased-to-21-–-What-Will-Happen-Next"><a href="#Gambling-Age-Increased-to-21-–-What-Will-Happen-Next" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Age Increased to 21 – What Will Happen Next?"></a>Gambling Age Increased to 21 – What Will Happen Next?</h1><p>On July 1, 2019, the gambling age in Nevada was increased from 18 to 21. The change follows a trend in several other states, including Utah and Maine, to raise the legal age for gambling. This has led to some speculation about what could happen next in the casino industry.</p>
<p>One potential change could be an increase in the minimum age for drinking alcohol at Nevada casinos. Currently, the minimum drinking age is 21 at all casinos in the state. It’s possible that this could be raised to accommodate the new gambling age.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that casinos might begin to focus more on luxury experiences instead of gambling. This is already happening in some cases, as casino operators try to attract high-rolling customers with expensive restaurants and accommodations.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that the increase in the gambling age will have minimal impact on the industry. Some people may choose to gamble illegally at older ages, and there’s also the possibility that young people will simply travel to other states where gambling is legal at 18.</p>
<p>What happens next in Nevada’s casino industry remains to be seen. However, it’s likely that there will continue to be changes in light of the increasing legal age for gambling.</p>
