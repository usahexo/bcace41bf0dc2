Although the book was published in 1948, the tips are still relevant today.</p>
<p>Tip #1: Always split Aces and 8s.</p>
<p>This is one of the most basic tips for playing blackjack. Splitting Aces allows you to double your bet and potentially get two more cards that could give you a winning hand. Splitting 8s also allows you to increase your chances of winning by doubling your bet.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Never take insurance.</p>
<p>Insurance is a sucker’s bet, and you should always avoid it. The odds of winning when taking insurance are not in your favor, so it’s best to steer clear.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Double down on 11.</p>
<p>Doubling down on 11 is another great way to increase your chances of winning at blackjack. This move lets you double your bet and receive one more card from the dealer. If the next card is a 10 or face card, you have a good chance of winning the hand.</p>
<p>Tip #4: Be aware of dealer tells.</p>
<p>The dealer can give away important information about their hand by how they act before they reveal their cards. For example, if the dealer picks up their cards quickly, they are likely to have a weak hand and you can make an informed decision about whether or not to hit or stand.</p>

Here are some tricks that the top players use to bring in more winnings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use basic strategy: This involves making the best decision based on the cards you’re dealt and the dealer’s up card. For example, if you have 16 and the dealer has a 3, you should hit, even if it means going over 21. Basic strategy can help reduce the house edge to under 1%.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Count cards: This is a skill that takes practice, but can give you a edge over the house. By keeping track of which cards have been played, you can make better decisions about when to hold or hit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs: When you are dealt two cards of the same rank, you can choose to split them into two separate hands. This increases your chances of winning since you now have two chances to get a good hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double down: If you have a good hand (10 or 11), you can choose to double down and place an extra bet. This essentially doubles your chances of winning since you’ll get one more card and then must stand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use side bets: Many blackjack tables offer side bets, which are wagers that offer bigger payouts than the main game. However, these bets also come with bigger risks, so only make them if you’re comfortable with losing your entire stake.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By using these tips, you’ll give yourself a better chance of winning at blackjack and walking away with more money in your pocket!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Blackjack-and-Win-Every-Time-Tips-from-a-Meme-Lord"><a href="#How-to-Play-Blackjack-and-Win-Every-Time-Tips-from-a-Meme-Lord" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Blackjack and Win Every Time: Tips from a Meme Lord"></a>How to Play Blackjack and Win Every Time: Tips from a Meme Lord</h1><p>Buckle up, because I am about to drop some major blackjack knowledge on you all. I am what you would call a “meme lord”, and as such, know everything there is to know about this classic casino game. In this article, I will share with you my top tips on how to play blackjack and win every time.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it is important to always remember the basic rules of blackjack. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (a blackjack), or by reaching a point total that is higher than the dealer’s without going over 21. You can also choose to forfeit your hand and let the dealer take your bet instead - this is known as “taking a hit”.</p>
<p>In order to increase your chances of winning, it is important to make smart decisions regarding when to hit and when to stand. For instance, if you have a hard total of 12 points, you should always hit - unless the dealer has an Ace, in which case you should Stand pat (stay put). Conversely, if you have a soft total of 18 points or more, you should always stand.</p>
<p>Another key thing to remember is that you want to avoid busting (going over 21 points). If you have 17 points and hit another card, for example, you will end up with 18 points - which is likely to lose against the dealer’s 17 or lower score.</p>
<p>As well as following these basic guidelines, there are a few other tips that can help improve your odds of winning at blackjack. One such tip is to observe the other players at the table - this can give you insights into how they are playing and help you make better decisions. You can also try splitting your cards if they are of similar value (for example, two eights), in order to increase your chances of winning multiple pots.</p>
<p>Lastly, always remember that blackjack is a game of chance - no matter how well you may understand the rules, there is always the potential for things to go wrong. That said, if you stick to these basic tips and play smartly, you should be able to win most of the time!</p>

Well, look no further. George Orwell, gaming champion and all-around guru, is here to teach you his tricks of the trade.</p>
<p>Orwell has been playing blackjack since he was a young lad and has developed some winning strategies along the way. Here are a few of his best tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remember your odds</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is your odds. The odds of getting any particular card are 1 in 52, so keep that in mind when making your decisions.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Know when to hit and when to stand</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing when to hit and when to stand can be the difference between winning and losing. If you have a 12 and the dealer has a 2, for example, you should hit because your chances of beating the dealer are better than if you stood.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use basic strategy tables</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re not sure what to do in a particular situation, use a basic strategy table as a guide. These tables will tell you what the best move is in any given scenario.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Split pairs whenever possible</li>
</ol>
<p>When you have two cards of the same rank, always split them up. This gives you two chances of winning instead of one and increases your odds overall.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Stay calm and collected</li>
</ol>
<p>This may be easier said than done, but it’s important to stay calm and collected while playing blackjack. Making rash decisions can lead to poor results and costly mistakes.</p>

First popularized in the early 1800s as ‘vingt-et-un’ (21), the game has been enjoyed by millions of people around the world looking for a simple and straightforward way to gamble.</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the few casino games where you can actually beat the house if you play correctly. While Lady Luck always has a say in any game of chance, by following a few simple rules you can tilt the odds in your favour and walk away a winner.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll take you through everything you need to know about playing Blackjack like an old-school gamer. We’ll start by looking at the basic rules of the game, before teaching you some essential strategy tips that will help improve your chances of winning. Finally, we’ll show you how to use modern technology to enhance your Blackjack experience and take your gameplay to the next level.</p>
<p>Ready to learn? Let’s get started!</p>
<p>The Basic Rules of Blackjack</p>
<p>Blackjack is a relatively simple game that can be played with as few as one player and one deck of cards, or with up to eight players using two decks of cards. At its core, Blackjack is all about trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over – known as busting. The player who achieves 21 (or closest to it) wins the hand.</p>
<p>If both players have 21 or Bust, the hand is a push and no money changes hands. If one player has 21 and the other doesn’t, then the player with 21 automatically wins. In cases where both players have more than 21 (a ‘split pot’), the hand is further resolved based on each player’s second card, as explained below:</p>
<p>Aces are worth one or eleven points, whichever makes a better hand;</p>
<p>2s through 10 are worth face value;</p>
<p>An Ace and a 2 through 10 constitute a ‘blackjack’ and are automatically worth three points;</p>
<p>A Jack, Queen or King (JQK) are each worth ten points.</p>
<p>Here are some basic tips for playing Blackjack:</p>
<p>As with most casino games, it’s important to stick to basic strategy if you want to give yourself the best chance of winning;Never split 5s or 10s – these are considered good hands and shouldn’t be broken up;If you have two identically numbered cards (e.g. two Kings), split them up into two separate hands – this gives you two chances of getting closer to 21;Hit on 16 or less, stand on 17 or more;Double down if you have 11 or more points.(For more detailed information on basic strategy, see our accompanying article: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oldschoolgamermagazine.com/2018/10/05/how-to-play-blackjack-like-a-pro/"> How To Play Blackjack Like A Pro </a> )</p>
<p>The Showdown: Winning With Strategy Tips<br>Now that we know the basics of how to play Blackjack, let’s look at some essential strategy tips that can help improve our chances of winning:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know when to hit and when to stand – This may seem like common sense, but it’s important to remember that different hands call for different decisions. Generally speaking, you should hit when your hand is low (16 or less) and stand when your hand is high (17 or more). However, there are exceptions to this rule so it’s always important to weigh all your options before making a decision. For example: if you have an Ace and a 6 (a soft 17), it may be wiser to hit rather than stand – especially if there are lots of low cards left in the deck which could give you a better chance at busting your opponent’s hand).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remember that Ace + 2 &#x3D; 3 – One little known fact about Blackjack is that an Ace plus any other 2 card equals 3 (this also applies for 3s, 4s &amp; 5s). So if you happen to get dealt an Ace &amp; 2 card combination (known as a ‘pair’), don’t forget that this counts as three points towards your total instead of two!3) Use doubling down wisely – Doubling down is essentially when you double your bet after seeing your first two cards. It can be a great way increase your chances of winning provided you use it wisely. For example: if you have 11 points showing (the ace plus any number between 2-10), doubling down will give you another card and put you in much better position to win the hand</p>
